# ✔️basic-todo-list
 A pretty basic to-do/to do list.
 The code is open-source and you can do whatever you want to with it.
 ## Amazing, totally not mundane features:
  - 🔎 You can view current to-do tasks.
  - 🆕 You can add your own to-do tasks.
  - 🗑️ You can delete your own to-do tasks.
  - 🏁 You can even quit the to-do program, wow.
 ### Thank you for taking the time to look at my simple program.
